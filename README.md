 Installation<br>
 Extract the plugin .zip file to your game folder.

V1.1.0 no longer requires a cylinder.<br>
<br>

However, the cylinder mode is retained as it allows for finer adjustments.<br>

"KKS_OSR2LinkST" This is a plug-in that works with Koikatsu Sunshine's CharaStudio.
KKS_OSR2LinkST gets the motion of a "cylinder" object placed in the scene.
At the same time, it synchronizes the OSR2 device with the movement of the "cylinder".

His NodesConstraints plugin by another author is practically mandatory.
Use NodesConstraints to pair cylinders with character IK etc.
You can synchronize the up-and-down movement and swing movement that is poured into the character with the movement of OSR2.

Looking ahead, I'm not sure it's possible.
I'm thinking of a function to send the movement of the character to OSR2.
If I can do that, I feel like I can use it in the mainGame.

<h3>next update<br></H3>
Next, I would like to support the free H mode of the main game.<br>
But I don't know if that is possible.
